# Player Warps

Player Warps are a feature of TnologyMC that allow anyone to create a warp that other players can teleport to.

There is a Player Warp GUI that can be accessed by typing `/pwarp`. Hovering over a warp shows information about the warp, including who made the warp, where the warp is, how many visits it has, and the description of the warp.


**Going to Player Warps**

To go to a Player Warp, type `/pwarp <Warp Name>`.

Player Warps can have ratings, out of 5 stars. To rate a warp, type `/pwarp rate <Warp Name> <Number between 1 and 5>`.

**Creating Player Warps**

To create a Player Warp, type `/pwarp set <Warp Name>`. Creating a Player Warp costs $1,000. Depending on what rank you have, you can set a specific amount of Player Warps:

**Default (No Rank)** - 5 Player Warp Limit

**Iron Rank** - 10 Player Warp Limit

**Gold Rank** - 15 Player Warp Limit

**Diamond Rank** - 20 Player Warp Limit

**Obsidian Rank** - 25 Player Warp Limit

**Configuring Player Warps**

To rename a Player Warp, type `/pwarp rename <Warp Name> <New Warp Name>`.

To set a different position for your Player Warp, type `/pwarp reset <Warp Name>`.

To set a description for a Player Warp, type `/pwarp desc set <Warp Name> <Description>`. To remove the Player Warp description, type `/pwarp desc remove <Warp Name>`.

To set a cost for players to teleport to your Player Warp, type `/pwarp cost set <Warp Name> <Cost>`. To remove the cost, type `/pwarp cost remove <Warp Name>`.

To set a password required for players to teleport to your Player Warp, type `/pwarp password set <Warp Name> <Password>`. To remove the password, type `/pwarp password remove <Warp Name>`.

To ban a player from a Player Warp, type `/pwarp ban set <Warp Name> <Player to Ban>`. To see a list of banned players for your warp, type `/pwarp ban list <Warp Name>`. To unban a player from a Player Warp, type `/pwarp ban remove <Player Warp> <Player to Unban>`.

To lock a Player Warp, which prevents other players from teleporting to it, type `/pwarp lock <Warp Name>`. Run `/pwarp lock <Warp Name>` again to unlock the Player Warp.

To remove a Player Warp, type `/pwarp remove <Warp Name>`.

To set a new owner, type `/pwarp setowner <Warp Name> <New Owner>`. Note that once this is done, you cannot get your warp back unless the new owner gives back the warp.
