<br>

**Step 3:** Right click the sign with redstone. Text should now appear on the sign.

(Note: If you accidentally right click a sign you don't want to link, type `/rs clear`.

<br>

**Step 4:** Right click the lever or button with the same piece of redstone dust.

<br>

**Step 5:** Place a repeater going into the sign. You will need to power this repeater to activate the wireless redstone. In this picture, there is a lever, which activates the wireless redstone when turned on.

<br>

That's it! Now, you are ready to use the wireless redstone.

# Wireless Redstone - Sign Modes


**Note:** You can also watch an example of a Basic Wireless Redstone Link on YouTube: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcDYOfOhGzU

<br>


**Step 1:** Refer to Steps 1 through 3, including Step 3, in the [Basic Link](https://github.com/TnologyMC/TnologyMC/wiki/Custom-Redstone#wireless-redstone---basic-link) Wiki page.

<br>

**Step 2:** Type your sign mode command by typing `/rs signmode <signmode>`. Here are the sign modes:

NORMAL - `/rs signmode NORMAL` makes the wireless redstone behave as normal.

INVERTED - `/rs signmode INVERTED` makes the wireless redstone behave the opposite way it does by default. When the wireless redstone is not activated by the repeater, the wireless redstone is powered, and vice versa.

FLIP_FLOP - `/rs signmode FLIP_FLOP` makes the redstone behave similar to normal, but different. When you activate the repeater, the wireless redstone will be activated. However, when you deactivate the repeater, it will stay activated. Then, activating the repeater again causes the wireless redstone to not be activated, and disabling the repeater again makes the wireless redstone not be activated. This process repeats.

<br>

**Step 3:** Proceed with Steps 4 and 5 from the [Basic Link](https://github.com/TnologyMC/TnologyMC/wiki/Custom-Redstone#wireless-redstone---basic-link) Wiki page.

<br>

Now, you have successfully created a wireless redstone link with a sign mode. Congratulations!




# Custom Redstone Clock Sign

**Note:** You can also watch an example of a Custom Redstone Clock Sign on YouTube: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IDxQHb5KBIA

<br>

**Step 1:** Place an empty sign.

<br>

**Step 2:** Place a repeater facing towards the empty sign.

<br>

**Step 3:** While facing the sign, type `/clock <ticks>`, with `<ticks>` being the amount of ticks you want for the clock to be on. For example, if you do `/clock 20`, it will be a 1-second clock, as there are 20 ticks in a second in Minecraft. If you receive the message, "You must look at a sign!" even while looking at the sign, try moving your character and looking at the sign at a different angle.

**Step 4:** Place a lever behind the oak sign.

<br>

**Step 5:** Power the repeater facing the oak sign to activate the clock for the lever behind the oak sign.
