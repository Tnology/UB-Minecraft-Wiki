# Money

TnologyMC has an in-game currency system. The currency, which uses dollars, is what is used for the Auction House and buying ranks. You can earn money from the following:

- In-Game Jobs
- Selling an item on the Auction House
- Having someone give you money via `/pay`
- Winning a giveaway in our Discord (https://discord.gg/vKbjwMw)

Money is an important feature of TnologyMC. While it's not required to have it when playing the server, having it makes your experience better.



# Jobs

One of the methods of earning money is via jobs. Jobs allow you to earn money by performing specific actions. For example, the "Miner" job will give you money for mining underground, and the "Enchanter" job will give you money for enchanting. To view the jobs available, type `/jobs browse`. Then, to join a job, type `/jobs join <job name>`. You can join up to 3 jobs at a time. Additionally, you will earn EXP and level up your jobs as you use them. In order to view the stats of your job, type `/jobs stats.`. It is highly recommended to join jobs that are best suited for you.




# Auction House

Another method of earning money is via the Auction House. The Auction House is a user-run shop for selling items. To view the Auction House, type `/ah`. You will see the item itself, who is selling it, and how much it costs. To buy an item that you can afford and want to buy, click on the item and confirm your purchase. To sell an item on the auction house, hold the item you want to sell, and type `/ah sell <price>`. For example, if you want to sell 3 diamonds for $100, hold 3 diamonds in your hand and type `/ah sell 100`. If you want to view your items you have listed on the Auction House, type `/ah selling`. You can click any item in this menu to stop selling this item and return it to you. After 30 days, if no one has purchased your item, it will expire. To retrieve your expired items, type `/ah expired`, and click on the item(s) you want back.




# Ranks


Additionally, TnologyMC has ranks purchasable Ranks provide in-game benefits to your gameplay experience. **_However, these are NOT and will NEVER BE PURCHASABLE FOR REAL-LIFE MONEY._** Why? The reason is simple: At TnologyMC, we strive to provide a non-P2W experience. Pay-to-Win (PTW/P2W) means when you can spend real-life money in return for a (usually competitive) advantage in-game. We will never be pay-to-win, and if we ever get a store with purchasable ranks, they will be purely cosmetic. You can get ranks via the in-game TnologyMC shop, which you can access via `/shop`. They are purchased with in-game money.

# Contributor Rank

Contributor Rank is a rank that is nearly impossible to get in TnologyMC. Even contributing largely isn't likely to get you this rank. Instead, you need to contribute so hugely to TnologyMC, that TnologyMC likely wouldn't even have a chance to survive without it, and keeping TnologyMC the way it is because of it. Even then, it's still hard to get this rank.

The benefits of [Contributor] Rank are not publicly listed, as we don't want people to try to get the rank just for the benefits.




# Player Vaults

Upon getting one of the four purchasable in-game ranks, you will get Player Vaults! Player Vaults are a way to easily store things, without needing a physical block (e.g. a chest). They can be accessed anywhere by typing `/pv <number>`. The amount of player vaults you have is limited to the number of player vaults your rank allows.
