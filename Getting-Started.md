# Getting Started

This page covers how you can get started in TnologyMC. When you first join the game, you will spawn at the server spawn. You can always come back to this place by typing `/spawn`. You may notice that you are unable to break the blocks at or near spawn. This is intentional. You can teleport to a random place by typing `/wild`. _However, before doing so, make sure you learn about the server first!_ To learn about the server, you can use `/tutorial` and view the tutorial for each category, or read the pages of this wiki. Either way, it will answer a ton of your questions and save your time asking questions.

Once you have read this wiki, come back and read below.

To start your journey in TnologyMC, type `/wild`. Have fun! :)
