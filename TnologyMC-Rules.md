# Rules

**[1]** Absolutely no attacks of any person and/or service would be allowed. If you use common sense, you know not to post someone's face reveal, IP address, or to DDoS or doxx someone. Common sense also applies to many of these rules.

**[2]** No faking evidence of any player.

**[3]** No scamming anyone anywhere, for anything, for any reason. You can be punished for scams that are outside of TnologyMC, such as scamming someone out of real-life USD for in-game money.

**[4]** No in-game hacking. The usage of modifications that give you an unfair advantage over other players, as well as X-Ray Resource Packs, count as hacks.

**[5]** No spamming or flooding the chat, or encouraging anyone else to do so. An example of spam would be sending the same message 10 times in 5 seconds, although this is up to staff discretion.

**[6]** No advertising. This applies for advertising other Minecraft Servers, as well as other things, such as Discord Servers. Advertising things in-game (e.g. Auction House sales and Player Warps) is completely fine. If you post any NSFW links (e.g. links that lead to nudity/porn streamers), your punishment will be more severe. If you post any links that lead to blood/gore, your punishment will be even more severe.

**[7]** No being extremely toxic. Also, use common sense. Just because a rule isn't posted here, that doesn't mean you can do something that you obviously can't.

**[8]** No posting any download links anywhere, whether it's safe or not. If it's proven to be malware, regardless of whether or not it's within your knowledge, you will get severe punishment.

**[9]** No ban evasion. This would include using an alt account to evade a ban, or to use an alt account to chat in order to evade a mute.

**[10]** Using any glitch or bug that allows you to get a significant advantage when you are not supposed to use it will result in punishment. An example of this would be trapping the wither in blocks to easily kill it and get EXP + a nether star.

**[11]** No lag machines on TnologyMC. Go build one on a pay-to-win server instead.

**[12]** Griefing is not allowed. This includes external griefing, such as griefing around someone's base.




# Notes

**(1)** You can and will still be punished if it was a sibling, friend, or someone else on your family account. Exceptions can be made if your account was hacked, but you must provide adequate proof in your appeal.

**(2)** Buying in-game items for real-life money from other people in the server is highly discouraged. We may not handle scams regarding buying items for real-life currency. Additionally, even if we do, it's not likely we can get your money back.




# Punishment Information


**Punishment Types:** Warning, Mute, Tempban (Temporary Ban), Permban, IP-Ban

Here at TnologyMC, we train our staff to not be strict. This means they likely won't tempban you if you are spamming 10 messages in 5 seconds on your first offense, but they'll still put their foot down and tell you to stop before they punish you (if you proceed to keep spamming).

While warning are not permanently active on your account, they _are_ active for 90 days.

`Warning Times are for Times Listed.`
**5 Active Warnings** - 3-Day Tempban
**10 Active Warnings** - 7-Day Tempban
**15 Active Warnings** - 14-Day Tempban
**20 Active Warnings** - 30-Day Tempban**
**25 Active Warnings - 90-Day Tempban**


**Note:** Only the owner, T_nology, is allowed to pardon IP-bans.
