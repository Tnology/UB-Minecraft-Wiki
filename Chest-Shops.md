# Chest Shops 

Chest Shops are a feature of TnologyMC in which signs are used with physical chests for items to be sold to players, as well as for players to be able to sell a specific item to the shop.

**Creating a Chest Shop**

To create a Chest Shop, simply place a sign on the front of a chest, or 1 block away from the chest, with the following format:

First Line: [Empty, put nothing here]

Second Line: The amount of money to buy or sell

Third Line: A combination of buy and/or sell prices. "B" is for items bought by players, while "S" is for items sold by players. If there are both, they are separated by a colon. You can put "free" if the price is free.

Fourth Line: The Name/ID of the item. You can put a "?" in the fourth line to have the item automatically chosen.

Here are some examples of Chest Shops:
